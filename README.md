# Assessing-Security-Culture

In this assignment, the focus was on understanding and promoting security awareness within organizations, with a particular emphasis on mitigating risks associated with employees using personal devices for work-related activities. The scenario involved employees at SilverCorp using their personal mobile phones for work tasks, presenting potential security vulnerabilities. Through external research, I identified three potential attacks related to this practice. The preferred behavior in the given scenario was for employees to refrain from conducting work-related activities on personal devices. To measure compliance, methods such as surveys were suggested, with the goal of having less than 5% of employees engaging in such risky behavior. 

In the second step, involvement of key individuals and departments was outlined, including IT, HR, management, legal, and employees themselves, each with specific roles and responsibilities. The training plan, a crucial component of the security culture framework, was detailed in terms of frequency, format, and topics covered, with an emphasis on the effectiveness measurement post-training. Additionally, I explored two alternative solutions, each categorized by control type, goal, advantages, and disadvantages, acknowledging that training alone might not be a comprehensive solution to security concerns.
